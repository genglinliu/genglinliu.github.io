Hi there! My name is Genglin Liu (刘庚麟), and I am a second-year Masters student in the CS department at [Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). Previously I received my undergraduate degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics from [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). I've worked as a graduate research assistant with [Prof. Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at the [BLENDER Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html), and [Prof. Hao Peng](https://haopeng-nlp.github.io/) at UIUC as well. Before that, I worked at the [Information Fusion Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/) advised by [Prof. Ina Fiterau](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mfiterau/) and the TRIPODS Institute for Theoretical Foundations of Data Science at UMass Amherst advised by [Prof. Yulong Lu](https://sites.google.com/site/yulongmath/home?authuser=0) as a research intern.


Research Interests
-----
My most recent research interest lies in studying the bahaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) and mitigating the undesirable text generation such as hallucinated and harmful content. More broadly speaking, I am interested in many topics that are at the intersection of natural language processing, multimodal agents, and cognitive science. Ultimately I would like to build safer and more responsible AI systems that act in alignment to human values.
