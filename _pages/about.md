Hi there! I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Computer Science, at [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), advised by [Prof. Saadia Gabriel](https://saadiagabriel.com/). Previously I received my Master's degree in CS at [Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and [Prof. Hao Peng](https://haopeng-nlp.github.io/). I received undergraduate degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics from [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). I worked at the [Information Fusion Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/) advised by [Prof. Ina Fiterau](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mfiterau/) and the TRIPODS Institute for Theoretical Foundations of Data Science at UMass Amherst advised by [Prof. Yulong Lu](https://sites.google.com/site/yulongmath/home?authuser=0) as a research intern.


Research Interests
-----
I'm broadly interested in Large Language Models and agentic systems powered by them. Most recently I've been working extensively on web agents, self-evolving models, and memory mechanisms of LLM agents. During my PhD I've worked on *multi-agent simulation systems* (EMNLP 2025 Oral, NeurIPS 2025) and *LLM safety* (COLM 2025). In more distant past I've worked on *benchmarking and evaluations* (NeurIPS 2024), *video-language models* (NeurIPS 2023), and *multilingual NLP* (ACL workshop 2023).
