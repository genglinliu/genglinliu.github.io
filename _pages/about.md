Hi there! My name is Genglin Liu and I am a second-year Masters student in the CS department at Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Previously I received B.S. in both Computer Science and Mathematics from University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass Amherst). I've worked as a graduate research assistant with Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at the [BLENDER Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). Before that, I worked at the [Information Fusion Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/) advised by Prof. [Ina Fiterau](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mfiterau/) and the TRIPODS Institute for Theoretical Foundations of Data Science at UMass Amherst advised by Prof. [Yulong Lu](https://sites.google.com/site/yulongmath/home?authuser=0) as a research intern.


Research Interests
-----
My most recent research interest lies in studying the bahaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) and mitigating the undesirable text generation such as hallucinated and harmful content. More broadly speaking, I am interested in many topics that are at the intersection of natural language processing, multimodal learning, and cognitive science. Ultimately I would like to building safer and more helpful AI agents that act in alignment to human values.

My first-authored papers have appeared on ACL 23 workshop, and I have been involved in several projects that are in submission to NeurIPS 23, EMNLP 23, ACL Rolling Review, and the Journal of Neuroscience.
