Hi there! My name is Genglin Liu and I am a second-year Masters student in the CS department at Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Previously I received B.S. in both Computer Science and Mathematics from University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass Amherst). I've worked as a graduate research assistant with Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at the [BLENDER Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). Before that, I worked at the [Information Fusion Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/) advised by Prof. [Ina Fiterau](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mfiterau/) and the TRIPODS Institute for Theoretical Foundations of Data Science at UMass Amherst advised by Prof. [Yulong Lu](https://sites.google.com/site/yulongmath/home?authuser=0) as a research intern.

Research Interests
======
My most recent research interest lies in studying the bahaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) and mitigating the undesirable text generation such as hallucinated and harmful content. More broadly speaking, I am interested in many topics that are at the intersection of natural language processing, multimodal learning, and cognitive science. Ultimately I would like to building safer and more helpful AI agents that act in alignment to human values.

My first-authored papers have appeared on ACL 23 workshop, and I have been involved in several projects that are in submission to NeurIPS 23, EMNLP 23, ACL Rolling Review, and the Journal of Neuroscience.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
